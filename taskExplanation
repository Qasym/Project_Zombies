PROBLEM STATEMENT Imagine, you are the organizer of Cake competition in Zombie-Land. 
There are 4
kind of zombies in Zombie-Land: “Zombie” is an ancient resident of Zombie-Land “Ladder Zombie”, “Newspaper Zombie”, “Dancing Zombie” are grandsons of “Zombie”.
Difference between grandsons of “Zombie” is that each of them has their own super-powers.

Type  TypeName          Power
0     Ancient Zombie    No super power
1     Ladder Zombie     Every 4 seconds eats 20 grams of cake
2     Newspaper Zombie  Every 6 seconds eats 30 grams of cake, BUT every 10 seconds reads a newspaper and does not eat ANY cake
3     Dancing Zombie    Every 3 seconds eats 25 grams of cake, BUT every 7 seconds dances and does not eat ANY cake

Note that all of them have their initial cake eating speed (explained below).
Winner in Cake competition: In a Cake competition there are N zombies, you need to find which zombie will finish eating their cake faster than other zombies.
Notes: 
1. No default speed, it will be given as input for every zombie participant. 
2. For more information check out main() method. 
3. It is guaranteed that there is only one winner.

Zombies of type 1,2,3 are children of class 0. 
Each class should have member name and speed, a constructor (Zombie(string name, int speed){}), toString() method, you may add additional methods for calculations

//Actually this task was given as a midterm problem for java coders(at another university), thus I can't show code here, I can only describe what each method does.

TASK 
1. Complete Zombie, LadderZombie, NewspaperZombie, DancingZombie classes
2. Modify toString() method in the following manner (refer to sample input and output):
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Ancient Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Ladder Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Newspaper Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Dancing Zombies are the best!
3. Finish whoIsTheWinner() method for identifying the winner zombie.

INPUT FORMAT Input is handled for you. Refer to the main method for more information. //It was not handled for me, I did everything from scratch
OUTPUT FORMAT Output is handled for you. Refer to the main method for more information.

SAMPLE INPUT 1 
2          <-- Input type
3 300           //In my code I have ignored the given number of participants
2 Archie 40     //300 / 40 = 7 seconds; 20 grams left, but every 6 seconds eats 30 grams of cake, thus result == 7;
3 Alisa 50      //300 / 50 = 6 seconds; result == 6; //winner
1 Ommy 30       //300 / 30 = 10 seconds; each 4 seconds eats 20 grams of cake result == 8;

SAMPLE OUTPUT 1 
Competition with 300 grams of cake: 
Alisa is the winner! Dancing Zombies are the best!

EXPLANATION 1 
300 – given weight of cake to finish (in grams) 
3 – number of competitor(s) 
2 – Type of zombie (from the table above: 2 - NewspaperZombie) 
Archie – Name of zombie 
40 – speed of zombie (how much weight of cake can eat in seconds. Ex: 40 gram/s)

SAMPLE INPUT 2 
1     <-- Input type
0 Berik 536

SAMPLE OUTPUT 2 
Berik is the winner! Ancient Zombies are the best!

SAMPLE INPUT 3 
1 
1 Erik 162

SAMPLE OUTPUT 3 
Erik is the winner! Ladder Zombies are the best!

SAMPLE INPUT 4 
1 
2 Dias 417

SAMPLE OUTPUT 4 
Dias is the winner! Newspaper Zombies are the best!

SAMPLE INPUT 5 
1 
3 Nazerke 141

SAMPLE OUTPUT 5 
Nazerke is the winner! Dancing Zombies are the best!

Input type 1: checks the implementation of classs
Input type 2: checks the implementation and whoIsTheWinner() method
