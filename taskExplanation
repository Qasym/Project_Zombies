PROBLEM STATEMENT Imagine, you are the organizer of Cake competition in Zombie-Land. 
There are 4
kind of zombies in Zombie-Land: “Zombie” is an ancient resident of Zombie-Land “Ladder Zombie”, “Newspaper Zombie”, “Dancing Zombie” are grandsons of “Zombie”.
Difference between grandsons of “Zombie” is that each of them has their own super-powers.

Type  TypeName          Power
0     Ancient Zombie    No super power
1     Ladder Zombie     Every 4 seconds eats 20 grams of cake
2     Newspaper Zombie  Every 6 seconds eats 30 grams of cake, BUT every 10 seconds reads a newspaper and does not eat ANY cake
3     Dancing Zombie    Every 3 seconds eats 25 grams of cake, BUT every 7 seconds dances and does not eat ANY cake

Note that all of them have their initial cake eating speed (explained below).
Winner in Cake competition: In a Cake competition there are N zombies, you need to find which zombie will finish eating their cake faster than other zombies.
Notes: 
1. No default speed, it will be given as input for every zombie participant. 
2. For more information check out main() method. 
3. It is guaranteed that there is only one winner.

Zombies of type 1,2,3 are children of class 0. 
Each class should have member name and speed, a constructor (Zombie(string name, int speed){}), toString() method, you may add additional methods for calculations

//Actually this task was given as a midterm problem for java coders(at another university), thus I can't show code here, I can only describe what each method does.

TASK 
1. Complete Zombie, LadderZombie, NewspaperZombie, DancingZombie classes
2. Modify toString() method in the following manner (refer to sample input and output):
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Ancient Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Ladder Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Newspaper Zombies are the best!
{{Zombie’s name}} is the winner! Dancing Zombies are the best!
